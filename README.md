The project on color detection of sample

The meter calibrate with the current environment by reading RGB color using photo transistor. There is averaged five readings in R, G and B. And these will be maximum possible data set.
Three samples are consecutively entered for three major color points.


Then automatic time time interval is set.


After that the projected sample is kept in the cavity. The meter will read nearest color of the three pivot points.
